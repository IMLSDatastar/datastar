#
# Where is the Vitro core directory?
# In most deployments, this is set to ./vitro-core (It is not uncommon for this 
# setting to point elsewhere in development environments).
#   Examples:
#      vitro.core.dir = ./vitro-core
#      vitro.core.dir = ../vitro
#      vitro.core.dir = /usr/local/vitro/trunk
vitro.core.dir = ../vitro

# Since Datastar is built on top of the VIVO application, we will also need to indicate where the VIVO code resides
# Where is the NIH-VIVO directory?
nihvivo.dir = ./vitro-core

#
# The base install directory for your Tomcat server. The VIVO application 
# will be deployed in the /webapps directory below this base. 
#
tomcat.home = /usr/local/tomcat

#
# The name of the VIVO application. This will be used as the name of the
# subdirectory within your Tomcat server's /webapps directory. It also appears
# in the URL for the application. For example, http://my.vivo.server/vivo
#
webapp.name = datastarimls

#
# The location where the VIVO application will store the data that it creates.
# This includes uploaded files (usually images) and the search index.
# Note, this directory will also hold runtime.properties for the application
#
vitro.home = /usr/local/vivo/home
